# DAC_Linearity
pycharm project for computing DAC Linearity

The dac_linearity.py is a python class to compute for DAC parameters such as DNL, INL, and TUE

The dac_linearity_labview.py also computes for DAC parameters such as DNL, INL, and TUE but it is intended to be used with LabVIEW's python node. 

Run the dac_script.py to see how the dac_linearity.py works. Feel free to edit this one and experiment with your own DAC raw data files. I have provided a sample file named "linearity.csv" to try out the modules.
